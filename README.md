# RE-PAK
UI Based Tool that allows for Previewing (PC)Textures on the fly, Extracting Paks, and Creating PAKs AND modding other platforms(PS4)

# Notes Before You Get Started
* For PAK Creation you do need the orginal PAKs extracted from the platform you intend to create them for(PC => PC, PS4 => PS4) **They Are Not Substitutable With Different Platform PAKS SO DO NOT TRY AND MIX THEM**
* Mods that replace DLC Outfits will not work on the PS4 from my testing, so make sure you read the mod page.
* Example PAKs can be found in this repo, thier credits will be inside the zip in a text document or posted below

# Requirements
* Extracted Game PC/PS4
* [PS4-RE-TEX](https://github.com/Backporter/PS4-RE-TEX) - For PS4 Textures.

# Using PAK Creator
Open the PAK Creatior select open/save, pick the orginal paks from the game, click Create and it will create it, place the two generated paks in the game with the currect name, and it should load as shown below.
