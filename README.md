# RE-PAK
UI Based Tool that allows for Previewing (PC)Textures on the fly, Extracting Paks, and hopefully in creating PAKs

# Notes Before You Get Started
* For PAK Creation you do need the orginal PAKs extracted from the platform you intend to create them for(PC => PC, PS4 => PS4) **They Are Not Substitutable With Different Platform PAKS SO DO NOT TRY AND MIX THEM**

# Requirements
* Extracted Game PC/PS4
* [SSE-Fallout-4-Texture-Converter](https://github.com/Backporter/SSE-Fallout-4-Texture-Converter - for textures

# Using PAK Creator
Generate the required database for the files you want to pack via the "Generate Database From Directory", than open PAK Creatior select open/save, pick the database you generated, pick the orginal pak that contains the info on the assets(you can select more than one), than select the path you want to save your pak at, click create and it will create it, place that pak in the game with the currect name, and it should load as shown below.
